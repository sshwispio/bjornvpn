# Generates a Random MD5 Hash for the USB Attack:


* echo "snow" | mkpasswd --stdin --method=md5

Use Cases:

* setenv security 'MD5-Salted-Hash'




# UART / SPI Hacking, aka JTAG or Serial Bus Root:


* setenv security = Set Env Security

* printenv security = Print Env Security

* setenv = Set Environment Values

* printenv = Print Environment Values

* saveenv = Save Environment Values


# References and Definition of Terms:


* UART = Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter.

* SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface.

# About Me


I currently work for Information Security in Dallas, Texas and yes I find Loop-Holes in a System. I am an Electronics Hacker and Loves Port Scanning, Fuzzing and Boundary Scanning all my Life. Former Web Vulnerabilities Exploit Researcher and I fond myself with OpenVPN (of whom I am certainly good at, As I own a VPN Network of which is my Sideline Business). I am an avid Security Researcher who likes to Research all kinds of Hacks. I am a CISSP Student and soon-to-be. I usually study under the Shadows with VPN under my Masks. Which means you can't find me. My Quote? "Hard to Find, Easy to Talk, But Difficult to Handle." as I am a once Hard-Headed ignorrant Hacker. But would listen under circumstances of neccessities and yes, I would help you. If I can understand your Situation. And if you really need it.
